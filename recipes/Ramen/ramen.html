    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup thinly sliced carrot</li>
        <li>¾ cup sliced celery</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cooked chicken and ramen noodles. Simmer, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with lime zest and, if you like, additional basil and oregano leaves, and serve with Honey-Sriracha Crackers.</li>
